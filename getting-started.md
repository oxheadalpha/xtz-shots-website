### What is this ?

[Tezos](https://tezos.com) is a proof-of-stake blockchain.

This website helps people operating blockchain nodes to synchronize new blockchain nodes, so they are operational faster.

This project was sponsored by a grant from the [Tezos foundation](https://tezos.foundation/).

### How to use

We are the first snapshot website to provide **permalinks**: URLs that never change and reliably point to a recent snapshot.

For example, to download a recent full snapshot of Tezos mainnet, simply do:

```
wget https://mainnet.xtz-shots.io/full
```

More details can be found in the [snapshot page](https://mainnet.xtz-shots.io).

### How does it work ?

The snapshot generation engine is deployed on [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

All source code is [open source](https://github.com/midl-dev/tezos-snapshot-generator) so anyone can deploy a separate snapshot generator setup in the cloud.
